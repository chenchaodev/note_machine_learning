    "1. Make it work: write the code in a simple legible ways.\n",
    "2. Make it work reliably: write automated test cases, make really sure that your algorithm is right and that if you break it, the tests will capture the breakage.\n",
    "3. Optimize the code by profiling simple use-cases to find the bottlenecks and speeding up these bottleneck, finding a better algorithm or implementation. Keep in mind that a trade off should be found between profiling on a realistic example and the simplicity and speed of execution of the code. For efficient work, it is best to work with profiling runs lasting around 10s."
